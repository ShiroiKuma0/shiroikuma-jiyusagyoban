/**
 * Running one action of a task on its own, to tune it without re-running everything.
 *
 * The action is executed as a one-action copy of its own task, so it keeps the task's identity,
 * collision policy and project. That matters: a single-action run and a full run of the same task
 * touch the same task-scoped variables, and sharing the id is what makes the collision policy
 * apply to both. It also means the run-log row already carries the right task.
 *
 * Flow-control markers are excluded. An `if` without its `end if` is not a smaller program, it is
 * a broken one, and running a `for each` alone would either do nothing or abort at a closing
 * marker that is no longer there.
