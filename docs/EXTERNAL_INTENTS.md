# External Automation Intents

OpenTasker exposes a narrow broadcast receiver so other apps can trigger user-created automation without binding to internal services.

## Security boundary

Receiver: `com.opentasker.core.external.AutomationTargetReceiver`  
Required permission: `com.opentasker.permission.AUTOMATION`

The receiver is exported only behind this custom permission. Callers should send explicit broadcasts to the OpenTasker package and use ordered broadcasts when they need result extras.

## Home Assistant Companion command vocabulary

The `integration.home_assistant.webhook` action accepts the Home Assistant Companion envelope
directly when its `message` and `data` fields are used:

```json
{
  "message": "command_broadcast_intent",
  "data": {
    "intent_package_name": "com.opentasker.app",
    "intent_action": "com.opentasker.action.RUN_TASK",
    "intent_extras": "com.opentasker.extra.PROTOCOL_VERSION:2:int,com.opentasker.extra.TASK_ID:1:long"
  }
}
```

The command value and field names follow the [Home Assistant Companion notification command
contract](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notification-commands/). The
raw `payload` field remains available for arbitrary webhook JSON and is mutually exclusive with
`message`/`data`; `command_*` values are checked against the documented command vocabulary.

Home Assistant's `command_broadcast_intent` is a payload message, not a replacement for
OpenTasker's namespaced Android actions. OpenTasker keeps `RUN_TASK`, `SET_PROFILE_ENABLED`,
`QUERY_STATUS`, and `QUERY_EXECUTION` unchanged, and protocol-v2 callers must still provide
`com.opentasker.extra.PROTOCOL_VERSION=2`.

## ntfy push and broadcast compatibility

UnifiedPush JSON and the token-authenticated `com.opentasker.action.PUSH_EVENT` receiver accept
ntfy's standard names `id`, `base_url`, `topic`, `title`, `time`, `encoding`, `content_type`,
`tags`, `tags_map`, `priority`, `muted`, `muted_str`, `attachment_name`, `attachment_type`,
`attachment_size`, and `attachment_expires`. The existing `eventId` and namespaced extras remain
accepted as compatibility aliases.

For a no-adapter ntfy notification action, publish an action whose intent is
`com.opentasker.action.PUSH_EVENT` and whose string extras include:

```text
com.opentasker.extra.PUSH_TOKEN=<the per-install token>
topic=<topic>
id=<unique event id>
```

ntfy documents this as the `broadcast` action and supports `extras.<name>=<value>` in its short
form. OpenTasker does not register the unauthenticated `io.heckel.ntfy.MESSAGE_RECEIVED` action:
an arbitrary installed app could otherwise inject a push trigger. The message body is accepted
for size accounting but is deliberately omitted from event metadata and logs; this is the one
intentional divergence from ntfy's `message` extra. Click and attachment URLs are also omitted
because they can contain credentials or remote identifiers. Use `topic`, `id`, `title`, `tags`,
and the other bounded metadata fields for event matching.

## Actions

### Run a task (asynchronous, protocol v2)

Action: `com.opentasker.action.RUN_TASK`

Runs are **asynchronous**. The receiver authenticates and validates the request, hands the run to
the foreground engine service, and replies immediately with an execution ID. It never waits for the
task: Android expects broadcast work to finish in roughly 10 seconds while an OpenTasker task can
wait up to 30 minutes, so a reply that carried the task's terminal result was reporting an outcome
that had not happened yet — and the system could kill the receiver mid-run with no run-log entry.

Callers **must** declare the protocol version. A request without it is refused with an explicit
error naming the required extra, rather than being silently reinterpreted.

Extras:

| Extra | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `com.opentasker.extra.PROTOCOL_VERSION` | int | **Required**, must be `2`. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.TASK_ID` | long | Preferred stable local ID. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.TASK_NAME` | string | Case-insensitive fallback lookup. |
| `com.opentasker.var.<Name>` | string-compatible | Optional task variables. Names must match `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,63}`. |

Ordered-broadcast result extras:

| Extra | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `com.opentasker.extra.PROTOCOL_VERSION` | int | The version this build speaks. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.ACCEPTED` | boolean | `true` once the run is validated and enqueued. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.EXECUTION_ID` | string | Poll this with `QUERY_EXECUTION`. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.EXECUTION_STATE` | string | `ACCEPTED` on a successful request. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.EXECUTION_TERMINAL` | boolean | Always `false` here — acceptance is not completion. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.ERROR` | string, present on failure |  |

The run appears in the normal Run Log with its usual redaction, sourced as `External intent`.

### Query an execution

Action: `com.opentasker.action.QUERY_EXECUTION`

Extras:

| Extra | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `com.opentasker.extra.EXECUTION_ID` | string | **Required**, from the `RUN_TASK` reply. |

Ordered-broadcast result extras:

| Extra | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `com.opentasker.extra.EXECUTION_STATE` | string | `ACCEPTED`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, or `UNKNOWN`. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.EXECUTION_TERMINAL` | boolean | `true` only for `SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED`. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.TASK_SUCCESS` | boolean | Meaningful only once terminal. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.TASK_DURATION_MS` | long |  |
| `com.opentasker.extra.ERROR` | string | Present for `FAILED` and `UNKNOWN`. |

Results are retained for the 64 most recent executions and survive a process restart. An execution
that was in flight when the engine's process died resolves to `FAILED`, so a caller never polls a
non-terminal state forever. An id that was never issued (or has aged out) reports `UNKNOWN`.

### Set profile enabled state

Action: `com.opentasker.action.SET_PROFILE_ENABLED`

Extras:

| Extra | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `com.opentasker.extra.PROFILE_ID` | long | Preferred stable local ID. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.PROFILE_NAME` | string | Case-insensitive fallback lookup. |
| `com.opentasker.extra.ENABLED` | boolean | Desired enabled state. |

### Query status

Action: `com.opentasker.action.QUERY_STATUS`

Optional extras:

| Extra | Type |
|---|---|
| `com.opentasker.extra.PROFILE_ID` | long |
| `com.opentasker.extra.PROFILE_NAME` | string |

Ordered-broadcast result extras include task/profile counts, enabled profile count, and profile-specific enabled/context state when a profile is found.
