# Changelog

## v0.2.5 — 2026-05-04

WiFi trigger hardening pass.

Exact alarm hardening pass.

- Removed `USE_EXACT_ALARM` so OpenTasker no longer declares the alarm-clock/calendar-only permission.
- Added an app-owned time tick scheduler that uses exact `AlarmManager` delivery when allowed and inexact `setWindow()` fallback when exact alarms are denied.
- Replaced the manifest `TIME_TICK` dependency with an internal scheduled receiver and exact-alarm permission-change rescheduling.
- Added focused unit coverage for minute-boundary scheduling.
- Updated setup text and README/roadmap metadata for exact-alarm fallback behavior.

Permission onboarding pass.
